The Jekyll gem makes a jekyll executable available to you in your Terminal window. You can use this command in a number of ways:
 <!--more-->
 
{% highlight code %}
$ jekyll build
# => The current folder will be generated into ./_site

$ jekyll build --destination <destination>
# => The current folder will be generated into <destination>

$ jekyll build --source <source> --destination <destination>
# => The <source> folder will be generated into <destination>

$ jekyll build --watch
# => The current folder will be generated into ./_site,
#    watched for changes, and regenerated automatically.
{% endhighlight %}

<blockquote>
	<h4>Changes to _config.yml are not included during automatic regeneration.</h4>
	The <code>_config.yml</code> master configuration file contains global configurations and variable definitions that are read once at execution time. Changes made to _config.yml during automatic regeneration are not loaded until the next execution.
Note <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/datafiles/">Data Files</a> are included and reloaded during automatic regeneration.
